From the early days of Native American tribes to the modern-day adrenaline-fueled excursions, the history of white water rafting in Idaho is as rich and diverse as the landscapes it traverses.
                                        Native Americans, including the Nez Perce and Shoshone-Bannock tribes, were among the first to navigate the roaring waters of Idaho's rivers for trade, transportation, and sustenance. Their intimate knowledge of the waterways laid the foundation for future exploration and discovery by European settlers.<br><br>
                    In the late 19th century, intrepid explorers and prospectors ventured into Idaho's remote regions in search of gold, silver, and other valuable resources. These pioneers often relied on rafts and makeshift boats to navigate the treacherous rapids, inadvertently laying the groundwork for the burgeoning recreational activity of white water rafting.<br><br>
                    The early to mid-20th century saw the emergence of organized white water rafting trips in Idaho, with adventurous souls drawn to the challenge of conquering the state's wild rivers. With the establishment of commercial outfitters and improved equipment, white water rafting became increasingly accessible to thrill-seekers from all walks of life.</p>
